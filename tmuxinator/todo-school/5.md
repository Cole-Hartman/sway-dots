─── BIO Plan ───
SUMMER 2025
Try to get in state tuition but just take it either way

LAHC
- Apply before summer
- Try to get async class, worst case you just pay out of state

PCC
- Might be able to select resident and get away with it like the first time
- "you were classified out of state based off answers in your application"
- Try to get async class, worst case you just pay out of state

CSULB
- Do NOT get your hopes up, its probably mon-thur
- Would probably rather just take it senior year but we'll see
